# ✅ **FIXED: Frontend/Backend Connection Issues**

## 🔧 **What Was Wrong**

You were getting **"Registration failed: Failed to fetch"** because:

1. **Frontend URL**: `file:///Z:/SPRL/BATTEL/index.html` (local file)
2. **Backend URL**: `http://localhost:3000` (web server)
3. **Problem**: Browsers block local files from making web requests (CORS policy)

## ✅ **What I Fixed**

### **1. Added Static File Serving**
- Backend now serves the frontend files
- No more CORS issues between frontend and backend
- Everything runs on the same origin: `http://localhost:3000`

### **2. Updated Launch Scripts**
- `run.bat` and `run.sh` now open the correct URL
- Clear warnings about using the right URL
- Automatic browser opening with correct address

## 🚀 **How to Use Now**

### **Restart Your Server**
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C in backend terminal)
# Then run:
run.bat
```

### **Use the CORRECT URL**
```
❌ WRONG: file:///Z:/SPRL/BATTEL/index.html
✅ CORRECT: http://localhost:3000/index.html
```

### **Test Registration**
1. Open: http://localhost:3000/index.html
2. Register: test@example.com / password123
3. Should work without "Failed to fetch" error!
